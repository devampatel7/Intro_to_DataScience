## Two Files - Linear Regression Exercise and Multiple Linear Regression Exercise 

### Linear Regression 
With the use of Jupyter Notebook and a 365 Data Science Course, I learned how to use raw data and gain meaningful insights from such data. For instance, I learned how to preprosses the dataset and deal with any missing values and outliers. This was mostly focused on syntax and getting used to Python. In addition, I also demonstrated how to to visualize descriptive statistics through PDFs and other distribution graphs. Furthermore, I displayed how to identify relationships and correlations through techniques such as logging a variable in the data set, this helps identify clear relationships. 

### Multiple Linear Regressions
In this excercise, I used real estate data to perform multiple linear regressions that would help predict the price of a house with a given size and year. Here, I dealt with multiple statistical methods to calculate important factors such as R squared and adjusted R squared, and ultimately estimate the price with the model. Finally, I was also able to calculate significance of each factor and determine wether it played a substantial role in prediction.
